# InitialETL
Initial work with sample data on etl pipelines

Documenting very first work with ETL pipeline task, mostly to showcase that I managed to do quite a large amount (and upload to a new repo)
on the very first day of working on the project/task (Thursday 02 June 2022, the first bank holiday day we have off for the jubilee)
particularly in terms of insights

Here is a very brief overview off the top of my head of what I have done so far
Note i have removed some extra fields from the sample data set to test my code for better cleaning,
I've also altered some dates so calculating things like averages made a lot more sense

EXTRACT
Extracts data and dummifies any missing entries, then fills in any missing entries it can if valid
- e.g. if have a product_id but no product_amount for a user ive created a new ProductPricing db table that
- it checks again and then fills in the price data, this means that before where user 1054 would have been 
- completely ommited from the insights dataset, but now their data is entirely included

TRANSFORM
lots of value based insights from the given dataset, mostly (since im just adding lots still)
is outputted to the terminal, with some data saved to individual txt files for each user
these txt files will have different file names depending on if data is parsed from the entire datasets timeline
or from a specific date range. Some data is included in a new CustomerSpendingInsights table, which i will expand on shortly

LOAD
initially data is sent to CustomerSalesData_Staging table, and cleaned here before being set to the the final CustomerSalesData table
obviously wasnt entirely necessary but seemed like was the expected thing to do, 
and i guess if there were multiple data sources this would be a necessity
after data is loaded from the staging table to the final table the staging table is wiped

PLANS
many plans for expanding the insights in product specific insights, obviously moving my terminal data to txt files and relevant db tables
would like to start work on a super simple dashboard app with this data by the end of the bank holiday weekend using streamlit
would also like to expand and improve the db generally
considering a super simple ml algorithm for predicting revenues but might leave this for now

DB TABLES
CustomerSalesData_Staging
CustomerSalesData
CustomerSpendingInsights
ProductPricing

PERSONAL
am very very proud of what I have done so far, did make sure to point the class in the right direction during the task too as
everyone (except sean?) seemed to want to do this completely in python, not using sql queries
gave gentle nudges to the class in chat by highlighting the COUNT, AVG, AND SUM sql functions with some pseudocode on how to use them
despite what others thing I pretty much started at the same level as others (1 year of uni 8 years ago didnt do much to help me)
i just put an extreme amount of work into this and i love doing it, hence why i make rapid progress while others do not.

DASHBOARD APP

All from first days work
(got the task on Weds, today is thurs, only had 3 hours to work during class 10am to 1pm, though i worked throughout my lunch too so 4)

EXAMPLE 4 [SQL COMMANDS] 

feel this gives a good idea of my level of interest in data engineering and showcases my high level of commitment to my learning
through the timestamps (note I recently had surgery hence why I was up so early (because I tend to go to sleep quite early, between 6 and 9pm))
